## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at the Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R), A*STAR, Singapore.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Generative World Modelling**, with a focus on **3D vision** and **multi-modal generative models**.

I develop computational models that learn structured representations of the real world from images, videos, and multi-modal data, enabling **simulation, forecasting, and content generation in 3D environments**.
